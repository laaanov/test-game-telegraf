# Three Tap Heroes

Three young heroes are standing between an army of monsters and the innocent villagers! Help them coordinating their attacks to repel the enemies. But beware! Only the frontmost enemy can be damaged. If you miss and hit another target, you will loose hearts! If you run out of hearts or the enemy reaches the heroes, it's Game Over!

## What is this? 

Three Tap Heroes is an extremely simple Gamebot for Telegram. You play as a team of Heroes trying to fend off hordes of monsters as they arrive. You are in control of a Mage (left), a Knight (center) and a Ranger (left). Monsters approach from above and you are supposed to command the hero corresponding to the frontmost enemy. If you get it right, the enemy is defeated and you get points. If you command the wrong hero, the other enemies will exploit that brief distraction and sprint briefly onward. If at any time a monster reaches your heroes, it's game over. 

## Disclaimer

This project is very early in development. You might spot various errors in the code and find the program itself doing far less then it is supposed to. Plus I'm not exactly a pro in web development so take that into account. 

## Dependencies 

The game itself is written in Javascript using Phaser. Please refer to http://phaser.io/ for further details. 
The bot itself runs on Node.js using Telegraf (http://telegraf.js.org) and Express (http://expressjs.com/)
